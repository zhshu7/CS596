## Abstraction
The liquefaction of vitreous humor has a significant effect on the diffusion of drug in the process of intravitreal drug delivery. Considering that the liquification geometry varies from person to person, it would be helpful if we can predict the drug diffusion process and further more give suggestion on the injection point and frequency for each individual. This requires creating a simulation model for each individual based on the 3D imaging of the liquefaction structure of patients and doing numerical simulations based on the model. A well trained machine learning model will significantly improve the efficiency comparing with doing meshing and numerical analysis for each specific case. So, in this machine learning model, the input will be the liquefaction geometry of the vitreous and the injection point, output will be the time interval that the drug is in effect, or in other words, the time interval that the concentration at the retina is within the expected range. To train the model, we are planning to make use of the 3D images of eye structure with liquefaction parts identifiable (practical cases or random generated cases) as input. For output, we can either find a good indicator in clinical practice and use the record from hospital based on that or create numerical models for the limited number of cases and get the result based on the numerical simulation.
